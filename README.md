# CECS343 Math Learning Application
This is the term project for the California State University Class CECS343 (Introduction to Software Engineering). This is a simple app game that consists of math questions that are to be answered in a particular amount of time. Users can select their level of difficulty on addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The game is oriented towards young children, so there are no algebra questions. 

Note: 
The Java version of our app is our basic prototype. The same logic used in the Java version of the file will be used in the Web App version of the game, which will use JavaScript instead of Java. The Web App will be the actual code that will be released.
