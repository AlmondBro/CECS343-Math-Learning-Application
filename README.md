# CECS343 Math Learning Application
This is the term project for the California State University Class CECS343 (Introduction to Software Engineering). This is a simple app game that consists of math questions that are to be answered in a particular amount of time. Users can select their level of difficulty on addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The game is oriented towards young children, so there are no algebra questions.
